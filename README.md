To begin

A few key programs that is needed for the project to work:
1) Redis server https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nFwPTHOMIY
2) RedisInsight https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/
3) DockerDesktop https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
4) This entire project is in JAVA

Notes
You can either setup and install your own redis server onto your desktop OR use Docker images or containers to run the server. I would recommend using Docker desktop
You may try running the programs onto a virtual desktop if your VM supports nested virtualization, Docker itself is somewhat a VM(?) and will need nested virtualization enabled to be usable in your VM
You will need to enable WSL for DockerDesktop to work
